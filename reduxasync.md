# Thunk
## Using Redux actions to connect to remote APIs via Thunk Middleware

Action generators return a function, like this:
const get = (payload) => {
  return {
    type: 'GET',
    payload: payload
  }
}
- Must perform asynchronous action before dispatching to reducer.

- The action you dispatch from your React App returns a function,

- Not an actual action object, which is what Redux expects and requires

let api = 'https://api.mockable.io/api/v1/stuff';

export const get = () => dispatch => {
  return utils.fetchData(api).then(records => {
    dispatch(getAction(records));
  });
};

const getAction = payload => {
  return {
    type: 'GET',
    payload: payload,
  };
};

- Implement redux middleware: “thunk”

- Inspects every dispatched action

- Then lets it go through || processes dispatches what the function returns.

## What does thunk middleware look like?

export default store => next => action =>
  typeof action === 'function'
    ? action(store.dispatch, store.getState)
    : next(action);
- Middleware is a curried function that evaluates the action
## Either:
### Function gets invoked with the store’s dispatch() and getState() methods.
### (a normal action creator), it simply runs your action.
