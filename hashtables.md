# Hash tables 

#### Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

- In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.
- In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the library or the users it has been issued to etc.

## Hash Function

#### A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

- To achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is important to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:

- Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.

- Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.

- Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.

## Hash Tables 

#### A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. By using a good hash function, hashing can work well. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time required to search for an element in a hash table is O(1).

### hows to solve collision 

#### Separate chaining (open hashing)

#### Separate chaining is one of the most commonly used collision resolution techniques. It is usually implemented using linked lists. In separate chaining, each element of the hash table is a linked list. To store an element in the hash table you must insert it into a specific linked list. If there is any collision (i.e. two different elements have same hash value) then store both the elements in the same linked list.
