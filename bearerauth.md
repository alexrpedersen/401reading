# Bearer-Auth

## What is Bearer-Auth

#### Essentially what you are doing is taking the token created by basic-auth or oauth and authorizing that user to access the app by using bearer-auth

## How does it work?

#### Bearer Tokens are encoded JSON objects that “bear” or “contain” enough information for the server to assert that any client request that presents a valid token must have originated from a client that has previously authenticated themselves using either Basic or OAuth. 



## Tokens

#### Bearer tokens are sent to the user/client after the initial signin process. We take that token and authorize the user. 

## JWT Tokens 

#### JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties (servers, clients, etc) as a JSON object.
