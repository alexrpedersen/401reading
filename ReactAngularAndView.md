# React

## What is React

#### React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## How does it work?

#### React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.

## JSX

#### JSX is a full template language with javascript capabilities. React doesnâ€™t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages. SX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
