## Event Queues

#### Much of the NodeJS architecture is built around the use of events. All objects that emit events in NodeJS are instances of the EventEmitter constructor. EventEmitter’s are a great way to handle controlling asynchronous events. Functions can be registered as listeners for an event on instances of the EventEmitter class. These instances can emit events and pass the listener’s data.
