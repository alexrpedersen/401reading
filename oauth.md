# Oauth

## What is Oauth

#### If you’ve ever seen and/or used the pop-up dialog box to “Login With Google” (or Facebook, or Github), you’ve used OAuth as a client (user). What’s really going on? Officially, OAuth is “an open standard for access delegation” … In other words, OAuth serves as a way to give users the ability to grant application access to services, without giving the application their password.

## How does it work?

#### through a handshake we are able to get the information needed in order to use certain credentials for our own personal use. It really is just an exchange of information between us and a 3rd party

## Tokens

#### Tokens are users just to put it short and sweet.
