# Auth + Role Based Auth
## problems to solve
- valid user?
- Authorization of user?
- What parts of the app care?
- How to determine?
- Token data?
- UI and API contact

## Proposal
### <Auth /> component

- Based on permissions it gives access to a component or jsx or hides it.
- Must not use Redux
