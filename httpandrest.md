# HTTP and REST

## HTTP

#### Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is stateless
 
#### defines how req/res should be formatted

#### A HTTP/1.1 request is formatted in text and transferred using TCP. The first line of the request contains the METHOD, URL, and HTTP VERSION.

## REST

#### REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. In layman’s terms, is a means by which we can reference, manipulate, and transfer state. Rest uses a common set of methods (called “verbs”) to operate on the state of a resource (“noun”), generally using HTTP as the transfer protocol.

## REST methods include GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE/DESTROY
