# React Native

## React Native Ecosystem
- What is native development?
- Why is it important to develop a native app vs a responsive react app?
- It’s still just state and components
- But no HTML or CSS
- You can still “style” things using the framework guidelines

## Expo
- Expo Is the dev environment
- Snack is an online sandbox
- expo-cli is the local equivalent to create-react-app (you can eject)
- Running locally, you can use your own device or the official simulator
- Only Apple users can test iPhones
- Anyone can test android, but you need to start up an ADB from The Android Studio IDE
