# React Testing and Deployment

## How to test

#### Snapshots - Make assertions on the exact rendered markup (with content) at any state of the application.
#### Render Testing - Similar to snapshots, but allows for jQuery-like inspection of the virtual DOM tree
#### Shallow Testing - Executes and renders the called/container component, but does not compose children.
#### Mounting - Executes the full component and children. Allows for inspection of rendered Virtual DOM as well as the current state

## Deployment

#### React allows you to see changes as you write the code but that will not be the result when you are are deployed. In order to have that be the final result you will have to run 
`npm run build`
